# smd-adapter-boards

###This is a collection of adapter circuit boards that make it easier to incorporate [Surface Mount Device (SMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology) into breadboard prototypes. 

#####Please note that individual SMD components may not exactly fit our SMD footprints -- manufacturers do not always design their components to adhere strictly to stated footprints. Check the descriptions of particular adapter boards below for SMD components that we have verified to fit a given board.
